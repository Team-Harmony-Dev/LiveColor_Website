    <p>I love AI and automation, so naturally I chose to help with UI on a
                                color picking app. I very much enjoy developing with friends, even
                                if it's outside of my comfort zone. My favorite color in the app is
                                called "Jedi Night" a deep dark green.</p>

    <h2>Shealtiel Mulder</h2>
    <p>I enjoy creating beautiful UI experiences and using programming to
                                solve unique problems. I am very grateful for the opportunity to work
                                on this project alongside my colleagues and friends. My favourite color
                                in the app is called "Aggressive Baby Blue", what a silly name!</p>
